Go application examples
=======================

*[ Expected to be shown during, and provided as reference following the STL Go
workshop on 2022-09-21 ]*

These subdirectories contain very simple examples for implementing various types
of applications written in Go. Their `main.go`s have links at the top referring
to sample external resources. They also each have a `main_test.go` showing how
to implement basic unit testing for each application type.

As you review these apps, ask yourself ***how you would improve them*** so that
they are more "production-ready". I've deliberately left these in a sorry state
in order to provide MVP samples but also to facilitate discussion on improvement
opportunities.
